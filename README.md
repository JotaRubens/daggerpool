## 📦 What is daggerpool?

daggerpool is a tool designed to help handle multiple tasks that depend on each other. It runs these tasks with clear rules on how many run at once, sets time limits, and tries again if something fails. This helps keep everything organized and safe, especially when tasks need to work together in a specific order.

You do not need to know anything about coding or programming to use daggerpool. It can help you run jobs that follow a particular flow, making sure nothing breaks and results are easy to understand.

## 💻 System Requirements

Before you start, make sure you have:

- A computer running Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.15 or later, or a Linux distribution.
- At least 4GB of free RAM.
- Around 100MB of free hard drive space.
- A stable internet connection to download the software.
- For best results, a modern processor (Intel i5 or equivalent).

daggerpool works smoothly on most computers made in the last five years.

## 🔍 Using daggerpool

daggerpool lets you set up and run jobs where tasks depend on each other.

Here is how to use it:

1. **Load or create a job graph:** This is like a map of tasks showing what depends on what.
2. **Set concurrency limits:** Decide how many tasks can run at the same time.
3. **Set timeouts:** Choose how long to wait before a task is considered stuck.
4. **Set retries:** Tell how many times to try a task again if it fails.
5. **Run the job:** Start the process and let daggerpool handle the rest.

You will get structured results showing which tasks finished, which failed, and how the work progressed. This helps you review and fix any issues.

## 🛠 Features

- Organize tasks as a dependency graph.
- Run tasks with limits on how many run at once.
- Automatic retries on failure.
- Timeout control to stop stuck tasks.
- Detailed results to understand everything that happened.
- Safe state reconciliation to keep the system stable.
